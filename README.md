Poiesis
==========================

Basic utility that essentially mirrors the functionality of SSMSâ€™s back up & restore tasks, but within a C# application.

This app is meant to serve as an abstracted starting point for more advanced interactions with a proprietary SQL Server database, like scrambling personally identifiable customer information, etc.

Further, this app serves to demonstrate implementation of the following libraries:

  - Extended WPF Toolkit by Xceed
  - MVVM Light Toolkit by GalaSoft
  - Serilog
  - Syncfusion Metro Studio icons
